# WHAT IS SCREEN

This command in terminal is a terminal multiplexer that allows users to create multiple terminal sessions within a single window. It's similar in  to tmux , providing a way to run multiple command-line sessions, detach from them, and reattach to them later.

# WHY WE USE SCREEN

* Multitasking: With more screen real estate, you can view multiple applications simultaneously, reducing the need to switch back and forth, which can improve focus and workflow. For example, you could write a document on one screen while researching on another, or compare data sets side-by-side.
* Enhanced Information Visibility: Having more screen space allows you to open more windows and applications without feeling cramped, making it easier to see and work with different pieces of information at once. This can be particularly beneficial for data analysts, programmers, designers, and anyone who works with complex information.
* Improved Efficiency: Some tasks, like video editing, coding, or designing, benefit from having dedicated space for different tools and palettes. A screen multiplier can provide that dedicated space, streamlining your workflow and reducing the need to minimize and maximize windows.
* Immersive Gaming: Gamers often use screen multipliers for a more immersive experience, especially for games that benefit from a wider field of view or require multitasking between the game and other applications, like chat windows or strategy guides.
* Multi-Display Entertainment: Setting up multiple screens can enhance your movie watching, TV show viewing, or even casual browsing experience by expanding the visual canvas and creating a more engaging atmosphere.
